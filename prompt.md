create a Flask web application that is used to convert code from one language to another language. let's take it step by step

### step 1:
the design of the HTML web page  as follows:
1. The style should follow the material design guidelines.
2. there  no overlap between the items
3. drop-down menu for the output programming language it should contain the list of supported programming languages by openAI, it   under the title at the right
4. The drop-down menu for the input programming language should contain the list of supported programming languages by openAI, it   under the title at the left.
5. a text box for input code  under the drop-down menu for the input programming language on the right and fit ten lines of text  and size of  width= 300px and height: 150px
6.  a text box for output code  under the output programming language drop-down menu on the left and next to the text box for input code and size of  width= 300px and height: 150px
7.  the colours of the web page  light green.
8.  a button   with the action "convert"  at the  bottom middle of the page under the input text box

### step 2
the web application able to do the following:
1. the python app.py should pass a python list of all the supported languages in the ChatGPT engine currently that you know about them to the HTML template
2.  the user should select the input language from the input language drop-down menu which contains all the supported languages in the ChatGPT and select the output language from the output language drop-down menu which contains all the supported languages in the ChatGPT
3. the user should write the code that he wants to convert in the input text box
4. when the user clicks the convert  button  the code in the input text box  converted using openAI Python SDK from the selected programming language in the input programming language drop-down menu to the selected programming language in the output programming language drop-down menu and the result code  in the output text box
5. create the full implantation to convert from the input programming language to the output programming language using the OpenAI Python SDK

Create a Flask web application that allows users to convert code from one programming language to another. The application should have a user interface with two text areas for input and output code. It should also include drop-down menus for selecting the input and output programming languages. The input code textarea should be on the left side, and the output code textarea should be on the right side. The output code textarea should be readonly. The web page should follow material design guidelines with a light green background. Additionally, there should be a 'Convert' button below the input code textarea to initiate the conversion process. The application should use the OpenAI Chat Completions API to perform the code conversion.

The Python backend should be structured to handle the conversion process. It should include routes for rendering the HTML template, processing the conversion, and returning the converted code. The conversion logic should be implemented using the OpenAI Python SDK, specifically utilizing the Chat Completions API. The response from the API should be parsed to extract only the code portion, ensuring that the output code is presented cleanly in the web interface.

The HTML template should utilize Bootstrap for styling and layout. The input and output text areas should have appropriate class names for styling and functionality. Additionally, the drop-down menus for selecting the input and output languages should be populated with a list of supported programming languages retrieved from the server.

Finally, the web application should be thoroughly tested to ensure that it successfully converts code from one language to another and presents the output code in the designated textarea. Any potential errors or exceptions should be handled gracefully, providing a user-friendly experience.
