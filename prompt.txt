create a Flask web application that is used to convert code from one language to another language. let's take it step by step

step 1:
the design of the HTML web page  as follows:
1. The style should follow the material design guidelines.
2. there  no overlap between the items
3. drop-down menu for the output programming language it should contain the list of supported programming languages by openAI, it   under the title at the right
4. The drop-down menu for the input programming language should contain the list of supported programming languages by openAI, it   under the title at the left.
5. a text box for input code  under the drop-down menu for the input programming language on the right and fit ten lines of text  and size of  width= 300px and height: 150px
6.  a text box for output code  under the output programming language drop-down menu on the left and next to the text box for input code and size of  width= 300px and height: 150px
7.  the colours of the web page  light green.
8.  a button   with the action "convert"  at the  bottom middle of the page under the input text box

step 2
the web application able to do the following:
1. the python app.py should pass a python list of all the supported languages in the ChatGPT engine currently that you know about them to the HTML template
2.  the user should select the input language from the input language drop-down menu which contains all the supported languages in the ChatGPT and select the output language from the output language drop-down menu which contains all the supported languages in the ChatGPT
3. the user should write the code that he wants to convert in the input text box
4. when the user clicks the convert  button  the code in the input text box  converted using openAI Python SDK from the selected programming language in the input programming language drop-down menu to the selected programming language in the output programming language drop-down menu and the result code  in the output text box
5. create the full implantation to convert from the input programming language to the output programming language using the OpenAI Python SDK
